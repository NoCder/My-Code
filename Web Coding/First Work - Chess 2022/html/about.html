                <p>Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games. 
                    It is played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, 
                    commonly white and black. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's king.

                <p>Chess is played on a board of 64 squares arranged in eight vertical rows - files and eight horizontal rows - ranks. <br>
                    These squares alternate between two colours: one light and the other dark. <br>
                    The board is set between the two opponents so that each player has a light square at the right-hand corner.

                <p id="head">Objective</p>
                <p>When a player moves a piece to a square on which it attacks the enemy king that is, 
                    a square from which it could capture the king if the king is not shielded or movedâ€”the king is said to be in check. <br>
                    The game is won when one king is in check and cannot avoid capture on the next move - checkmate. <br><br>
                    There are three possible results in chess: win, lose, or draw. There are three common ways a draw can come about:

                    <li>by mutual consent,</li>
                    <li>when neither player has enough pieces to deliver checkmate,</li>
                    <li>hen a player who is not in check has no legal move (stalemate)</li>
