                <p>The board represents a battlefield in which two armies fight to capture each other's king. 
                    A player's army consists of 16 pieces that begin play on the two ranks closest to that player. 
                    There are six different types of pieces:

                    <p id="head">King</p>
                    <p>White’s king begins the game on e1. Black’s king is opposite at e8. Each king can move one square in any direction; e.g., White’s king can move from e1 to d1, d2, e2, f2, or f1.</p>

                <div><p id="head">Queen</p>
                    <p>Each player has one queen, which combines the powers of the rook and bishop and is thus the most mobile and powerful piece. The White queen begins at d1, the Black queen at d8.</p>

                </div>
                <div><p id="head">Rook</p>
                    <p>Each player has two rooks (formerly also known as castles), which begin the game on the corner squares a1 and h1 for White, a8 and h8 for Black. A rook can move vertically or horizontally to any unobstructed square along the file or rank on which it is placed.</p>

                </div>
                <div><p id="head">Knight</p>
                    <p>Each player has two knights, and they begin the game on the squares between their rooks and bishops—i.e., at b1 and g1 for White and b8 and g8 for Black. The knight has the trickiest move, an L-shape of two steps: first one square like a rook, then one square like a bishop, but always in a direction away from the starting square. A knight at e4 could move to f2, g3, g5, f6, d6, c5, c3, or d2. The knight has the unique ability to jump over any other piece to reach its destination. It always moves to a square of a different colour.</p>

                </div>
                <div><p id="head">Bishop</p>
                    <p>Each player has two bishops, and they begin the game at c1 and f1 for White, c8 and f8 for Black. A bishop can move to any unobstructed square on the diagonal on which it is placed. Therefore, each player has one bishop that travels only on light-coloured squares and one bishop that travels only on dark-coloured squares.</p>

                </div>
                <div><p id="head">Pawns</p>
                    <p>Each player has eight pawns, which begin the game on the second rank closest to each player; i.e., White’s pawns start at a2, b2, c2, and so on, while Black’s pawns start at a7, b7, c7, and so on. The pawns are unique in several ways. A pawn can move only forward; it can never retreat.</p>
