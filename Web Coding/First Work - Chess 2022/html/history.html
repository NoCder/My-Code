                <p>Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games. 
                    It is played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, 
                    commonly white and black. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's king.

                <p id="head">Ancient precursors and related games</p>
                <p>The origin of chess remains a matter of controversy. There is no credible evidence that chess existed in a form approaching the modern game before the 6th century CE. Game pieces found in <b>Russia</b>, <b>China</b>, <b>India</b>, <b>Central Asia</b>, <b>Pakistan</b>, and elsewhere that have been determined to be older than that are now regarded as coming from earlier distantly related board games, often involving dice and sometimes using playing boards of 100 or more squares.</p>
                <p>One of those earlier games was a war game called chaturanga, a Sanskrit name for a battle formation mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata. Chaturanga was flourishing in northwestern India by the 7th century and is regarded as the earliest precursor of modern chess because it had two key features found in all later chess variants—different pieces had different powers (unlike checkers and go), and victory was based on one piece, the king of modern chess.</p>
                <img src="https://www.nms.ac.uk/media/34344/h-chessmengroup.jpg?center=0.596938775510204,0.527522935779816&mode=crop&width=1920&height=800&rnd=133142791060000000" alt="ancient chess piece" width="450"  id="ChessPic1">
                <p>How chaturanga evolved is unclear. Some historians say chaturanga, perhaps played with dice on a 64-square board, gradually transformed into shatranj (or chatrang), a two-player game popular in northern <b>India</b>, <b>Pakistan</b>, <b>Afghanistan</b>, and <b>southern parts of Central Asia after 600 CE</b>. Shatranj resembled chaturanga but added a new piece, a firzān (counselor), which had nothing to do with any troop formation. A game of shatranj could be won either by eliminating all an opponent’s pieces (baring the king) or by ensuring the capture of the king. The initial positions of the pawns and knights have not changed, but there were considerable regional and temporal variations for the other pieces.</p>
                <b>
                    <p>The game spread to the east, north, and west, taking on sharply different characteristics. In the East, carried by Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders, and others, it was transformed into a game with inscribed disks that were often placed on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares. About 750 CE chess reached <b>China</b>, and by the 11th century it had come to <b>Japan</b> and <b>Korea</b>. <b>Chinese</b> chess, the most popular version of the Eastern game, has 9 files and 10 ranks as well as a boundary—the river, between the 5th and 6th ranks—that limits access to the enemy camp and makes the game slower than its Western cousin.</p>

                <p id="head">Introduction to Europe</p>
                <p>A form of chaturanga or shatranj made its way to Europe by way of Persia, the Byzantine Empire, and, perhaps most important of all, the expanding Arabian empire. The oldest recorded game, found in a 10th-century manuscript, was played between a Baghdad historian, believed to be a favourite of three successive caliphs, and a pupil.</p>

                <p>Muslims brought chess to <b>North Africa</b>, <b>Sicily</b>, and <b>Spain</b> by the <b>10th century</b>. Eastern Slavs spread it to Kievan Rus about the same time. The Vikings carried the game as far as <b>Iceland</b> and <b>England</b> and are believed responsible for the most famous collection of chessmen, 78 walrus-ivory pieces of various sets that were found on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides in 1831 and date from the 11th or 12th century. See Figure 2.</p>
                <p>Chess and dice games were periodically banned by kings and religious leaders. For example, King Louis IX forbade the game in France in 1254. However, the game’s popularity was helped by its social cachet: a chess set was often associated with wealth, knowledge, and power. It was a favourite of Kings Henry I, Henry II, John, and Richard I of England, of Philip II and Alfonso X (the Wise) of Spain, and of Ivan IV (the Terrible) of Russia. It was known as the royal game as early as the 15th century.</p>
                
                <p id="head">Standardization of rules</p>
                <p>The modern rules and appearance of pieces evolved slowly, with widespread regional variation. By 1300, for example, the pawn had acquired the ability to move two squares on its first turn, rather than only one at a time as it did in shatranj. But this rule did not win general acceptance throughout Europe for more than 300 years.</p>

                <b>
                    <p>Chess made its greatest progress after two crucial rule changes that became popular after <b>1475</b>. Until then the counselor was limited to moving one square diagonally at a time. And, because a pawn that reached the eighth rank could become only a counselor, pawn promotion was a relatively minor factor in the course of a game. But under the new rules the counselor underwent a sex change and gained vastly increased mobility to become the most powerful piece on the board—the modern queen. This and the increased value of pawn promotion added a dynamic new element to chess. Also, the chaturanga piece called the elephant, which had been limited to a two-square diagonal jump in shatranj, became the bishop, more than doubling its range.</p>
                </b>
                <p>Until these changes occurred, checkmate was relatively rare, and more often a game was decided by baring the king. With the new queen and bishop powers, the trench warfare of medieval chess was replaced by a game in which checkmate could be delivered in as few as two moves.</p>
                <p>The last two major changes in the rules—castling and the en passant capture—took longer to win acceptance. Both rules were known in the 15th century but had limited usage until the 18th century. Minor variations in other rules continued until the <b>late 19th century</b>; for example, it was not acceptable in many parts of Europe as late as the mid-19th century to promote a pawn to a queen if a player still had the original queen.</p>

                <p id="head">Women in chess</p>
                <img src="https://www.rubiconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_7046.jpg" alt="chess style" width="450"  id="ChessPic2">
                <p>Separation of the sexes in chess dates from about 1500 with the introduction of the queen. Chess became a much faster, more exciting game and, thus, came to be perceived as a more masculine pursuit. Women were often barred from the coffeehouses and taverns where chess clubs developed in the <b>19th century</b>. However, women players achieved distinction separately from men by the middle of the century. The first chess clubs specifically for women were organized in the <b>Netherlands in 1847</b>. The first chess book written by a woman, The ABC of Chess, by “A Lady” (H.I. Cooke), appeared in <b>England</b> in <b>1860</b> and went into 10 editions. <b>The first women’s tournament</b> was sponsored in <b>1884</b> by the Sussex Chess Association.</p>
                <p>Women also gained distinction in postal and problem chess during this period. An American woman, Ellen Gilbert, defeated a strong English amateur, George Gossip, twice in an international correspondence match in 1879—announcing checkmate in 21 moves in one game and in 35 moves in the other. Edith Winter-Wood composed more than 2,000 problems, 700 of which appeared in a book published in 1902.</p>
